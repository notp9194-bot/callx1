/**
 * StoryRingShaderCache — v40 "reverse advance" optimization.
 *
 * WHY: StoryRingGradientDrawable / ChatListStoryRingView were each building a
 * brand-new SweepGradient + Matrix on every bounds/size change. In a
 * RecyclerView (chat list, status row, reel comments, home feed) that means
 * a fresh shader + matrix allocation on almost every bind/recycle, even
 * though 95% of rings on screen share the exact same pixel size (e.g. every
 * avatar in the chat list is 48dp). That's needless GC churn = jank.
 *
 * FIX: All story rings now share ONE small LRU cache keyed by (width,height).
 * The first ring of a given size builds the shader once; every other ring of
 * that same size (every other row in the list) reuses the identical
 * SweepGradient object. Android Shaders are stateless/immutable once built,
 * so sharing one instance across many Paints on many views is safe.
 *
 * Cache is capped at 8 distinct sizes (small avatars, story feed thumbs,
 * reel/profile rings, etc.) — far more than the app actually uses at once —
 * so it can never grow unbounded.
